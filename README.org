Jump to Chinese characters using =ace-jump-char-mode= or =avy-goto-char= : input
the first letter of the pinyin of the Chinese character, then use
=ace-jump-char-mode= or =avy-goto-char= to jump to it.

*UPDATE*: The up-to-date version now supports [[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][avy]], which I personally think is
better than [[https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode][ace-jump-mode]]. However, by default this package is still using
=ace-jump-mode=.

*UPDATE*: Now =avy-goto-char-2= is also supported if you set
=ace-pinyin-use-avy= to be =t=.

* Setup
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ace-pinyin.el")
  : (require 'ace-pinyin)

  Or install via [[http://melpa.org/#/ace-pinyin][melpa]].
* Usage

  You can make the =ace-pinyin= use =avy= by:
  : (setq ace-pinyin-use-avy t)

  Note =ace-pinyin-use-avy= variable should be set *BEFORE* you call
  =ace-pinyin-globa-mode= or =turn-on-ace-pinyin-mode=.

  Example config to use =ace-pinyin= globally:
  : ;; (setq ace-pinyin-use-avy t) ;; uncomment if you want to use `avy'
  : (ace-pinyin-global-mode +1)

  If you want to turn on/off =ace-pinyin-mode= locally, don't directly call
  =ace-pinyin-mode=. Use =turn-on-ace-pinyin-mode= or =turn-off-ace-pinyin-mode=
  instead.

  When the minor mode is enabled, then =ace-jump-char-mode= (or =avy-goto-char=,
  depends on your config) will be able to jump to both Chinese and English
  characters. That is, you don't need remember an extra command or create extra
  key bindings in order to jump to Chinese character. Just enable the minor mode
  and use =ace-jump-char-mode= (or =avy-goto-char=) to jump to Chinese
  characters.

  Besides, all other packages using =ace-jump-char-mode= (or =avy-goto-char=)
  will also be able to jump to Chinese characters. For example, if you've
  installed [[https://github.com/waymondo/ace-jump-zap][ace-jump-zap]], it will also be able to zap to a Chinese character by
  the first letter of pinyin. Note =ace-jump-zap= is implemented by using
  =ace-jump-mode=, so you can't use =avy= in this case. You can check out my
  fork of =ace-jump-zap= using =avy=: [[https://github.com/cute-jumper/avy-zap][avy-zap]].

* Other available command
** =ace-pinyin-dwim=
   If called with no prefix, it can jump to both Chinese characters and English
   letters. If called with prefix, it can only jump to Chinese characters.

** =ace-pinyin-jump-word=
   Using this command, you can jump to the start of a sequence of Chinese
   characters(/i.e./ Chinese word) by typing the sequence of the first letters
   of these character's pinyins. If called without prefix, this command will
   read user's input with a default timeout 1 second(You can customize the
   timeout value). If called with prefix, then it will read input from the
   minibuffer and starts search after you press "enter".

* Demo
  *WARNING*: The demo is a little out of date. You should use
  =ace-pinyin-global-mode= (globally) or =turn-on-ace-pinyin-mode= (locally)
  instead of =ace-pinyin-mode= to enable the minor mode!

  Enable =ace-pinyin-mode= and use =ace-jump-char-mode= to jump to Chinese
  characters:

  If you have installed [[https://github.com/waymondo/ace-jump-zap][ace-jump-zap]], then enabling =ace-pinyin-mode= will also
  make =ace-jump-zap-to-char= capable of handling Chinese characters.
