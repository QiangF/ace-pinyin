Make =ace-jump-char-mode= capable of jumping to Chinese characters: input the
first letter of the pinyin of the Chinese character, then use
=ace-jump-char-mode= to jump to it.

* Setup
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ace-pinyin.el")
  : (require 'ace-pinyin)

  Or install via [[http://melpa.org/#/ace-pinyin][melpa]].
* Usage

  This package defines =ace-pinyin-mode= and =ace-pinyin-global-mode=. You can
  use
  : (ace-pinyin-mode +1)
  to enable the minor mode. If you want to enable it globally, you can use
  : (ace-pinyin-global-mode +1)

  If the minor mode is enabled, then =ace-jump-char-mode= will be able to jump
  to both Chinese and English characters. That is, you don't need remember an
  extra command to jump to Chinese character, just enable the minor mode and use
  =ace-jump-char-mode= to jump to Chinese characters. Besides, all other
  packages using =ace-jump-char-mode= will also be able to jump to Chinese
  characters. For example, if you've installed [[https://github.com/waymondo/ace-jump-zap][ace-jump-zap]], it will also be
  able to zap to a Chinese character by the first letter of pinyin.

*  Other available command
** =ace-pinyin-dwim=
   If called with no prefix, it can jump to both Chinese characters and English
   letters. If called with prefix, it can only jump to Chinese characters.

** =ace-pinyin-jump-word=
   Using this command, you can jump to the start of a sequence of Chinese
   characters(/i.e./ Chinese word) by typing the sequence of the first letters
   of these character's pinyins. If called without prefix, this command will
   read user's input with a default timeout 1 second(You can customize the
   timeout value). If called with prefix, then it will read input from the
   minibuffer and starts search after you press "enter".

* Demo
   Enable =ace-pinyin-mode= and use =ace-jump-char-mode= to jump to Chinese
   characters:

   If you have installed [[https://github.com/waymondo/ace-jump-zap][ace-jump-zap]], then enabling =ace-pinyin-mode= will also
   make =ace-jump-zap-to-char= capable of handling Chinese characters.
